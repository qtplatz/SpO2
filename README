malpix4 readme
==============

This is the git repository of malpix4.  As of the day writing this
(27-OCT-2014), origin of the repository is hosted on:

   ssh://multum.jp/var/lib/public_git/malpix4

The reposition folder structure is;

- transition

  This is all electrical matrials transferred from Dr. Kawai as fo
  23-OCT-2014

- malpix

  Start with source files transfered from Dr. Kawai with modified
  build system and folder structure in order to transition for large
  scale software.  First, I've changed build system with cmake over
  Makefile.  The cmake is widely accepted from many middle to large
  scale software projects, and flexible enough for not only
  multi-platform support but also common software foundations such as
  Qt, Boost and so forth.

- sandbox

  As folder name suggest, this is playground for trial software.  Make
  sevaral small snipped of software under this folder and validate
  algorithms.

=====================
Build malpix software
=====================

A part of malpix code is depend on QtPlatz project.  QtPlatz source
code should be exist under malpix4 (top) directory which can be done
as;

$ cd <malpix4 top directory>
$ git clone git://github.com/qtplatz/qtplatz.git

That results top directory looks like

malpix4/malpix
malpix4/qtplatz      <-- qtplatz add here
malpix4/sandbox
malpix4/transition
malpix4/profile.bat
malpix4/README       <-- this file

In case you have qtplatz soruce tree for different location, you can
edit malpix4/malpix/CMakeLists.txt file and replace QTPLATZ_SOURCE_DIR
value as appropriate.

--------------------
